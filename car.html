<h1>The World of cars</h1>
<hr>
<p>A car (or automobile) is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation. Most definitions of car say they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four tires, and mainly transport people rather than goods.</p>
<p>Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them. The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car when German inventor Karl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Cars became widely available in the early 20th century. One of the first cars that were accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts, but took much longer to be accepted in Western Europe and other parts of the world.</p>

<p>The Hennessey Venom GT is a high performance sports car manufactured by Texas-based Hennessey Performance Engineering. The Venom GT is based on the Lotus Elise/Exige.
On February 14, 2014, on the Kennedy Space Center's 3.22-mile (5.2 km) shuttle landing strip in Florida, the Hennessey team recorded a top speed of 270.49 mph (435.31 km/h) in an extremely limited distance of 2.3 miles (3.7 km) with the Director of Miller Motorsport Park, Brian Smith driving the car. As the run was in a single direction, and only 13 cars have been sold to date (to qualify for Guinness World Records Hennessey must build 30), it does not qualify as the world's fastest production car in the Guinness Book of Records.The driver, Brian Smith, said that it could go 5–10 mph (10–15 km/h) faster than the recorded 270.49 mph if they had more distance to run on.
